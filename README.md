# ColonyTrace
A comprehensive software suite for tracking the full lifespan of research mice.

## Current development outline
- At the moment the backend is Django and the frontend is React. This is subject to change as the project progresses.
- Modern UI design is important to make it broadly appealing.
- Need to consider mobile support since people will likely use phones or tablets when actually in animal facilities.
