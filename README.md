# ColonyTrace
A comprehensive software suite for tracking the full lifespan of research mice.

## Current development outline
- Backend will be built with Django unless we're feeling really ambitious and want to write it in Rust, but since this is just animal research I don't think that level of security is necessarily warranted.
- The interface will need to be very interactive in order for it to be simple and efficient to use, meaning frontend will likely be a dedicated react app or something like that.
- Modern UI design is important to make it broadly appealing.
- Need to consider mobile support since people will likely use phones or tablets when actually in animal facilities.
